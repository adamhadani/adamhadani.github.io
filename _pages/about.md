## About Me

I'm a technology professional with a passion for exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, software engineering, and mathematics. Currently at [Globality, Inc.](https://www.globality.com/), I work at the forefront of AI/ML applications, focusing on how emerging technologies can solve real-world problems across industries.

My interests span from the practical—building robust software systems and exploring architectural patterns—to the theoretical: diving into machine learning algorithms, deep learning architectures, and the mathematical foundations that power modern AI. I'm particularly fascinated by agentic AI systems, automation, and the potential of AI to transform how we work and create.

Beyond technology, I have a deep commitment to music and mathematics. As a musician, I've been the recipient of various musical scholarships and have had the privilege of performing around the world. My musical work has been featured in [Google Doodles](https://doodles.google/doodle/hedy-lamarrs-101st-birthday/), including the celebration of Hedy Lamarr's 101st birthday. I'm also an inventor, holding a [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180232443A1/en) for machine learning-driven technology.

This blog is my space to share insights, experiments, and thoughts on these topics—a personal corner of the internet where curiosity drives the conversation.
