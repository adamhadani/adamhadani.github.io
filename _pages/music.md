## My Music

Over the years I've performed and written music across a diverse range of genres and mediums. Below is a random sampling..


### Jazz

I've performed at various venues and festivals palying Jazz, especially in my younger years, often with my father, the great and accomplished guitar player, composer and all around bad dude [Amos Ever-Hadani](https://artlist.io/royalty-free-music/artist/amos-ever-hadani/2305)! 

A random selection of some recorded materials in no particular order:

- [Isolation Band - Change Partners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=212f8PRE9kw)
- [Isolation Band - Old Folks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOnFvvzHDk)
- [Isolation Band - Like Someone in Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XT1MqNMXaU)
- [Softly as in a morning sunshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6EEIhBUhYQ)


### Film, Beats, and what have yous

I've writte some short cinematic cues, beats and electronic music over the years. Most of it is [here on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/strjly). 

Some random selection of beats:

- [The Sound of Your Love](https://on.soundcloud.com/egN4ijE82eUA05J0cm)
- [Maybe we will meet again](https://on.soundcloud.com/3hXYssk38yUSyWgerp)
- [Flow with you](https://on.soundcloud.com/0dM5CN57aRJ8sFTGel)
- [hoover damn](https://on.soundcloud.com/TomG3MeXRwe0bzTpZi)
- [Heat](https://on.soundcloud.com/hJSyNlOoaVQyLfnotX) (if you're a UFC fighter in the making looking for a walkout tune this is it right here :-))
- [Enter the Knob](https://on.soundcloud.com/nH8hOqwNkcb3WGW8Mr)
- [Spaced out](https://on.soundcloud.com/ETGNRPVQgxhdgHuFkB)


Some of my music was featured in some films, TV etc. which one day i'll get around to collecting as well hopefully. 

My favorite somewhat recent feature is probably [SMB Bundi - SMB Freestyle](https://on.soundcloud.com/WFKfGOAhl6UnDfjgQR) - legit!

### Google Doodles

I had the incredible good fortune to score a couple of Google Doodles. If only hits on Google landing page paid royalties.. 

- [Google Doodle - Langston Hughes’ 113th Birthday](https://doodles.google/doodle/langston-hughes-113th-birthday/)
- [Google Doodle - Hedy Lamarr's 101st Birthday](https://doodles.google/doodle/hedy-lamarrs-101st-birthday/)
