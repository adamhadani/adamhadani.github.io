## My Music

Over the years I've performed and written music across a diverse range of genres and mediums. Below is a random sampling..


### Jazz

I've performed at various venues and festivals palying Jazz, especially in my younger years, often with my father, the great and accomplished guitar player [Amos Ever-Hadani](https://artlist.io/royalty-free-music/artist/amos-ever-hadani/2305)!. 

A random selection of some recorded materials in no particular order:

[Isolation Band - Change Partners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=212f8PRE9kw)
[Isolation Band - Old Folks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSOnFvvzHDk)
[Isolation Band - Like Someone in Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XT1MqNMXaU)
[Softly as in a morning sunshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6EEIhBUhYQ)


### Film, Beats, and what have yous

I've writte some short cinematic cues, beats and electronic music over the years. Most of it is [here on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/strjly). 

Some random selection of beats:

[The Sound of Your Love](https://on.soundcloud.com/egN4ijE82eUA05J0cm)
[Maybe we will meet again](https://on.soundcloud.com/3hXYssk38yUSyWgerp)
[Flow with you](https://on.soundcloud.com/0dM5CN57aRJ8sFTGel)
[Spaced out](https://on.soundcloud.com/ETGNRPVQgxhdgHuFkB)


Some of this was featured in some films, TV etc. which one day i'll get around to collecting. 

My favorite somewhat recent feature is probably [SMB Bundi - SMB Freestyle](https://on.soundcloud.com/WFKfGOAhl6UnDfjgQR)which would be my walkout tune for sure if I got picked up by UFC :-)

### Google Doodles

I had the incredible good fortune to score a couple of Google Doodles. If only hits on Google landing page paid royalties.. 

[Google Doodle - Langston Hughes’ 113th Birthday](https://doodles.google/doodle/langston-hughes-113th-birthday/)
[Google Doodle - Hedy Lamarr's 101st Birthday](https://doodles.google/doodle/hedy-lamarrs-101st-birthday/)
