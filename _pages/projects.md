## Projects

Here you'll find a collection of my technical projects, experiments, and open-source contributions.

### PromptRomp - Dev Tools for the LLM Generation

I'm a core member of [PromptRomp](https://github.com/promptromp/), an open-source organization building developer productivity tools for the age of AI-assisted development. Our mission is to create practical tooling that enhances developer workflows, particularly for teams leveraging LLM-enabled development practices.

**GitHub**: [github.com/promptromp](https://github.com/promptromp/)

**Key Projects**:

- **[pytest-impacted](https://github.com/promptromp/pytest-impacted)** - A smart testing utility that selectively runs only the tests affected by your code changes. Using git analysis and dependency mapping, it dramatically reduces test execution time while maintaining confidence in your test coverage.

- **[mockstack](https://github.com/promptromp/mockstack)** - An API mocking workhorse designed to streamline API development and testing workflows. Built to handle complex API simulation scenarios with ease.

All PromptRomp projects are open-source under the MIT license and welcome contributions from the community.
